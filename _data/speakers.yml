 - name: Dahlia Malkhi
   bio: "I am Chief Technology Officer at Diem Association, Lead Maintainer of the Diem project, and Lead Researcher at Novi.
I have applied and foundational research interest in broad aspects of reliability and security of distributed systems. For over two decades, I participated in driving innovation in tech, notably: co-inventor of HotStuff, co-founder and technical co-lead of VMware blockchain, co-inventor of Flexible Paxos, the technology behind Log Device, creator and tech lead of CorfuDB, a database-less database driving VMware’s NSX-T distributed control plane (see Corfu github repo), and co-inventor of the FairPlay project.
I joined the Diem (Libra) team in June 2019, first as a Lead Reseacher at Novi and later as Chief Technology Officer at the Diem Association. In 2014, after the closing of the Microsoft Research Silicon Valley lab, I co-founded VMware Research and became a Principal Researcher at VMware until June 2019. From 2004-2014, I was a principal researcher at Microsoft Research, Silicon Valley. From 1999-2007, I served as tenured associate professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. From 1995-1999, I was a senior researcher at AT&T Labs, NJ. I hold Ph.D., M.S. and B.S. in computer science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem."

 - name: Craig Gentry
   bio: "Craig Gentry is a Research Fellow at the Algorand Foundation. In 2009, while at Stanford and IBM, he constructed the first plausibly secure fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme, which allows anyone to perform arbitrary computations on encrypted data while it remains encrypted. For his work on FHE, he won the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award, the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award, and the MacArthur \"Genius\" Grant. He has since contributed to new generations of FHE schemes, the first cryptographic multilinear maps, the first cryptographic obfuscation scheme, and practical succinct zero-knowledge proof systems (variants of which are used in popular blockchains). He was named a fellow of the IACR in 2021."
