## Grading
TBA
<!--The class will have short written homework and hands-on labs. Weekly quizzes will all be of equal weight (graded on completion), and will count for 10% of your overall grade. In addition, each student will participate in a group project **(group size: 3-5 students)** of choice aiming to develop new solutions or analyze existing solutions and real-world deployment in DeFi. 

| Class participation | 10% |
| Weekly Quizzes | 10% |
| Lab 1 | 5% |
| Lab 2 | 15% |
| Project proposal | 5% |
| Project milestone | 15% |
| Project presentation and final report | 40% |

## Course Description
Decentralized trust has many advantages, including providing stronger security guarantees, enabling open access and participation, and providing transparency. Decentralized systems, such as blockchain, enable decentralized trust and empower new economies such as Decentralized Finance, Creators Economy, and Data Sovereignty. 

Our goal is to provide a framework for students to understand this new space of decentralized systems, from a technology, economic, and a policy perspective, and become familiar with open research challenges in the area. We will explore the foundations and applications of decentralization technology and decentralized intelligence. 

The course will consist of invited talks by a range of experts and related discussions. We will cover a variety of topics and current open research challenges and state-of-the-art techniques in a wide spectrum of areas, including:

<ul>
  <li>Foundations for next generation decentralization technologies: scalability, usability, provable guarantees, auditable privacy, etc.
  <li>Cryptoeconomics and mechanisms design for decentralized systems </li> 
  <li>Decentralized data science</li> 
  <li>Decentralized Finance and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) </li> 
  <li>Decentralized governance, organization </li> 
  <li>Decentralized intelligence, Data DAO for public good</li>
  <li>Responsible innovation and regulation in decentralized systems</li>
</ul>
