## Enrollment and Participation
Graduate students should enroll for CS294-196. Undergraduates should enroll for CS194-196.
 
This is a variable-unit course. The requirements for each unit load are listed below.
<ul>
  <li>1 unit: attend lectures (graded on participation only)</li>
  <li>2 units: attend lectures + complete a class project with a report</li>
  <li>3 units: attend lectures + complete a class project that includes significant implementation + project report</li>
</ul>


<!--For graduate students, please register for CS294-177; for undergraduate students, please register for CS194-177. Please join our [edstem](https://edstem.org/us/courses/7861/discussion/).

  };
</script>
-->

## Grading
Students taking the course for 1 unit will be graded on participation only.

Students taking the course for 2 or 3 units will be graded as follows:

| Class participation | 10% |
| Literature review | 10% |
| Project proposal | 15% |
| Project milestone | 15% |
| Project presentation and final report | 50% |


### Project

Students taking the course for 2 or 3 units of credit will complete an open-ended research project, which they will present both in the form of an oral presentation and a course report in workshop paper format. You will choose an area of decentralized systems to explore and read related literature in that area. Then, you will choose a problem in that space and either build a system (taking the class for 3 units of credit requires a project that involves significant implementation) or conduct an experiment to contribute to the solution or exploration of the problem you identified.

Students are welcome to choose their own topics. We will also provide a list of project ideas for inspiration. Group sizes TBA depending on enrollment.

### Timeline

| Group formation | 02/08 |
| Literature review | 02/22 |
| Project proposal | 03/08 |
| Project milestone | 04/12 |
| Project presentation | 05/03 |
| Project final report | 05/13 |

## Course Description
Decentralized trust has many advantages, including providing stronger security guarantees, enabling open access and participation, and providing transparency. Decentralized systems, such as blockchain, enable decentralized trust and empower new economies such as Decentralized Finance, Creators Economy, and Data Sovereignty. 

Our goal is to provide a framework for students to understand this new space of decentralized systems, from a technology, economic, and a policy perspective, and become familiar with open research challenges in the area. We will explore the foundations and applications of decentralization technology and decentralized intelligence. 

The course will consist of invited talks by a range of experts and related discussions. We will cover a variety of topics and current open research challenges and state-of-the-art techniques in a wide spectrum of areas, including:

<ul>
  <li>Foundations for next generation decentralization technologies: scalability, usability, provable guarantees, auditable privacy, etc.</li>
  <li>Cryptoeconomics and mechanisms design for decentralized systems </li> 
  <li>Decentralized data science</li> 
  <li>Decentralized Finance and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) </li> 
  <li>Decentralized governance, organization </li> 
  <li>Decentralized intelligence, Data DAO for public good</li>
  <li>Responsible innovation and regulation in decentralized systems</li>
</ul>
